## SQL Scripts for COVID-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL scripts for analyzing COVID-19 data. The scripts are designed to work with datasets containing information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, population statistics, and more.

## Summary

The SQL scripts provided in this repository are designed to analyze COVID-19 data, focusing on aspects such as:

- Verifying the correctness of data uploads.
- Calculating death percentages, population percentages, and infection rates.
- Identifying regions with the highest infection and death counts.
- Analyzing global statistics, including total cases, deaths, and population infection percentages.
- Joining COVID-19 death and vaccination datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- Utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables for efficient data manipulation.
- Creating views to simplify complex queries and enable reusability.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Execute the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL environment, ensuring that you have the necessary datasets (e.g., `covidDeaths$`, `covidVaccination$`).
3. Customize the scripts as needed for your specific analysis requirements.
4. Refer to the `README.md` file for detailed information on each script and its purpose.

## Dataset Requirements
